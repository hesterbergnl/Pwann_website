					<h4>I can drink here!</h4>
					<p>During summer of 2006, my family and I went to visit The Netherlands with Patrick and his family.  Patrick was freshly 16 and could legally drink in the Netherlands! Shortly after arriving, Patrick and I hopped on our bikes and headed to the grocery store.  I was only 14, but didn't hesitate to be Patrick's sidekick for this beer run.  Patrick went in and found the biggest quantity of beer he could fit on his bike: a case of 24 Amstel bottles.  Patrick rode all the way back to the summer house stabilizing the beer with one hand and stuggling to keep handlebar control with the other.  His smile shows exactly how happy he felt about it.</p>

					<h4>Hiking in the Alps</h4>
					<p>While visiting Europe, the we also spent a week in Switzerland with my aunt Mariaka.  Within an hour of getting there, Patrick and I decided that the summit of the mountain we were staying on wasn't all that far away. So we left for what we thought would be a hike to the summit.  We had no water, no food, no preparations; it was completely spontaneous. We ventured up the trail and quickly decided the switchbacks were going to take too long.  Intstead, we started bypassing the switchbacks, heading directly for the summit.  It was brutal.  There were steep inclines, thick brush, and slippery mud.  But the summit seemed so close.</p>
					<p>Eventually, after many of stops to catch our breath, we cleared the treeline.  The trees were gone but now we were hitting intermittent patches of snow and ice.  It was wild, exhausting, and so much fun.  After over an hour of hiking, we arrived at what we originally thought was the summit. In reality we were thousands of feet below the summit, but it was still an amazing view and an incredible adventure.</p>

					<h4>Patrick in DC</h4>
					<p>During the summer of 2013, I had an internship in Washinton DC, only a few hours from NYC where Patrick was living. Patrick came to visit me and we went downtown to visit the museums and monuments.  We spent the most time in the Smithsonian Air and space museum, our favorite one. Patrick wanted to spend most of the time in the kids section. He was excited by all the hands-on demonstrations, studying them and playing with everything he could. He went from exhibit to exhibit, brainstorming with me about ways he could replicate the demos in his classroom.</p>
					<p>This is a defining characteristic about Patrick that still inspires me everyday.  He worked so hard to help other people.  He wanted the absolute best education for his students and used his time at the museum to study demonstrations and figure out ways to better his teaching.  Patrick wanted nothing more than every single one of his students to go to college and have a fulfilling career.  He was and still is an inspiration to me and everyone of the students he worked with.</p>

					<h4>Patrick appears in the App State Physics Department</h4>
					<p>One day I was walking through the halls of the Physics department, waiting for a class to start.  It was early spring, time to apply for new internships for the summer.  I was looking through the various Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) posters and something caught my eye.  Is that <strong> PATRICK? </strong> It was! I knew he had done an REU at LeHigh University, and he was memorable enough that they made him the poster boy for the REU! Who better to advertise for an internship than a smart, fun loving, curly headed Patrick.</p>
					<p>This poster follows a broader theme for how Patrick has affected my life.  A huge part of why I wanted to study Physics/Engineering was because Patrick did it.  I looked up to him in every way when I was a kid, just as I do now. He showed me that hard work (and a lot of fun) really pays off in the end.  He was social, fun, intelligent, caring, and hardworking.  One of the best people I have ever met, and still the person I hope to one day become. I feel so fortunate to have spent time with him over the years. </p>

					<h4>The eternal stuggle of battling pwann</h4>
					<p>One day Patrick texted me and asked if I played chess. He had been playing a lot on his phone and wanted to play with me so we could keep in touch and have a little fun. I had taken a class in <em>elementary school</em> and remembered being pretty "good" back then.  So I told him I played and we started up a game through a phone app.  The first few games I got destroyed, and figured it was just going to take a few games to get back into it.  Many games later and I came to the realization that my elementary school moves wouldn't work on pwann. I got a chess theory book, started reading, and slow getting better. It didn't matter.  pwann was the chess master, and I had no chance.  We played over a hundred games and every single one ended with the same thing: "You have been mated".</p>
